# How to contribute

Welcome, and thanks for contributing to PHP-Docker!

## Reporting Bugs

Please include as much information as possible when reporting a bug, even if it might not seem relevant; for example:

* Host OS
* Which container you are having an issue with (php version, dev or non-dev)
* Any other containers you are using alongside the PHP-Docker container
* Steps to reproduce the problem
* Expected behavior vs actual behavior

It is also helpful to know if you are a new user or not; are you a new user, and the project is not doing something you'd hoped? Or have you used these containers before, and the issue just began in the past week?

## Pull Requests

These containers aim for a balance between usefulness and efficiency (small size, not a lot of extra overhead). We will happily accept pull requests, but if you are proposing anything large or complex, it may be best to create an issue beforhand.
